This project is to create an XML parser in Python capable of reading an LRG file
	LRG IN; FASTA OUT

Input:
	Pass file title to program as a string argument (cmd line)
	Optional argument to specify intronic sequence length around exons
	Pass optional command to specify genomic, cDNA, protein.. (genomic default)
	Program creates an output file based on the sequences used

Method:
	Command line arguments are supplied to specify the input file and specific parameters
	The appropriate sequence is read into a dictionary (multiple sequences where appropriate)
	Tree iteration is used to find the coordinate details for all exons
	The name of the output file is created using the input file title (LRG #)
	Using the coordinates and specific sequence type, the specific portions of sequence corresponding to each
		exon are output into a output file
	The presence of an existing file of the same title is checked
		If a file already exists, the user is prompted to overwrite (Y/N)
			If the user chooses to overwrite, the program continues
			If the user chooses not to, the program exits and reports that no output was created
	
	
Output:
	FastA file from LRG
	Each exon identified and corresponding sequence
	Details of exon (start, length..) and reference sequence 

 - where to store output (specify output path)

Testing:
	Valid input file/filename
	Required tags are present (not tampered with)
	correct sequence lengths
