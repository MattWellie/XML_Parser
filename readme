This project is to create an XML parser in Python capable of reading an LRG file


Goals:
 
LRG IN
FASTA OUT

Method:

Pass file title to program as a string argument (cmd line)
	pass optional command to specify genomic, cDNA, protein.. (genomic default)
	optional argument to specify intronic sequence length around exons
Read sequence (all?) into a variable

use tree iteration to find all exons


Output:
		
FastA file from LRG
Each exon identified and corresponding sequence
	Details of exon (start, length..)

 - where to store output (specify output path)

Testing:

Valid input file/filename
Required tags are present (not tampered with)
correct sequence lengths
